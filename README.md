# suggestion-system-discord.js version 14

Full/Advanced Suggestion System - discord.js version 14!

The files: suggestion.js, suggestionSetup.js are models and should be pasted in your models folder! | For MongoDB!

The files: setup-suggest.js, remove-suggest, suggest.js are commands and should be pasted in your commands folder!

The file: interactionCreate.js is an event that listens to buttons! | If you already have an interactionCreate event for your slash commands, do not delete it, just add this one into your events folder as well!

Credits to Kajdev for the interactionCreate event and the base of the suggest command!
