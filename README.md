# suggestion-system-discord.js

Full/Advanced Suggestion System - discord.js!

The files: setup-suggest.js, remove-suggest, suggest.js are commands and should be pasted in your commands folder!

The file: interactionCreate.js is an event that listens to buttons! | If you already have an interactionCreate event for your slash commands, do not delete it!

Credits to Kajdev for the interactionCreate event and the base of the suggest command!
